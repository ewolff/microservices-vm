Microservice VM
==============

This project creates a VM with the Microservices project https://github.com/innoq/microservice-consul and the
Continuous Delivery example https://github.com/innoq/user-registration-V2/. It is useful for workshops etc. 
Please see the project READMEs for further details on the samples.
The VM uses 4.5GB of RAM and 2 CPUs. Therefore it needs some ressources. Please
also note that a lot of software is installed on these machine i.e. it
will take quite a while to install and it will download considerable
amounts of data.

To run it:

- Install Virtual Box from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Install Vagrant as discussed at
http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html
- Run `build.sh` from the current directory (Linux / Mac OS X). If you
  are using Windows: run `build.cmd` instead.

To check the installation:

- There should be no errors displayed.... ;-)
- Enter `vagrant ssh` to login to the VM. If you use Windows, please
  refer to https://gist.github.com/haf/2843680 to get ssh working.
- `docker images` should return:
```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-wily-64:~$ docker images
